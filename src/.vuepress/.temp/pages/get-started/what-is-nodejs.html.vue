<p>Node.js is an open-source server environment that enables the execution of JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It's free, versatile, and runs seamlessly on various platforms including Windows, Linux, Unix, and macOS.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional web development, where JavaScript is mainly used for client-side scripting, Node.js enables you to execute JavaScript on the server-side.</p>

<p>At its core, Node.js is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which makes it fast and efficient. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which means that it can handle thousands of simultaneous connections without getting bogged down by blocking operations.</p>
<h3 id="why-node-js" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-node-js"><span>Why Node.js?</span></a></h3>
<p>One of the key reasons Node.js stands out is its asynchronous programming model. Traditionally, web servers would wait while performing tasks like opening files.</p>
<p>Node.js, however, sends tasks to the computer's file system and proceeds to handle the next request without waiting. This non-blocking, asynchronous approach enhances efficiency and responsiveness, making Node.js an excellent choice for handling concurrent operations.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Generate Dynamic Page Content</strong>: Node.js can dynamically generate web page content, making it a powerful tool for building dynamic web applications.</li>
<li><strong>File System Operations</strong>: With Node.js, you can perform various file system operations such as creating, opening, reading, writing, and deleting files on the server.</li>
<li><strong>Handle Form Data</strong>: Node.js can collect form data submitted by users on web forms.</li>
<li><strong>Database Operations</strong>: Node.js facilitates database operations, allowing you to add, delete, and modify data in your database.</li>
</ul>

<p>Node.js files contain tasks that execute in response to specific events, such as a user attempting to access a port on the server. These files, typically denoted with a &quot;.js&quot; extension, must be initiated on the server to take effect.</p>
