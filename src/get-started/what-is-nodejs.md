Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Instead of running JavaScript on the client-side (in a browser), Node.js enables you to run JavaScript on the server-side. It's commonly used for building web applications, APIs, and server-side scripting.

Node.js simplifies the process of building scalable network applications. It's built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which makes it fast and efficient. With Node.js, you can handle thousands of simultaneous connections with ease, making it ideal for real-time applications like chat servers and streaming services.

Node.js comes with a rich library of modules, making it easy to develop web servers and other network tools. These modules include functionalities for file system I/O, networking (HTTP, TCP, UDP, etc.), and even cryptography.
