It&#39;s free, versatile, and runs seamlessly on various platforms including Windows, Linux, Unix, and macOS.</p><p>Unlike traditional web development, where JavaScript is mainly used for client-side scripting, Node.js enables you to execute JavaScript on the server-side.</p><h3 id="how-does-node-js-work" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-does-node-js-work"><span>How Does Node.js Work?</span></a></h3><p>At its core, Node.js is built on Chrome&#39;s V8 JavaScript engine, which makes it fast and efficient. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which means that it can handle thousands of simultaneous connections without getting bogged down by blocking operations.</p><h3 id="why-node-js" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-node-js"><span>Why Node.js?</span></a></h3><p>One of the key reasons Node.js stands out is its asynchronous programming model. Traditionally, web servers would wait while performing tasks like opening files.</p><p>Node.js, however, sends tasks to the computer&#39;s file system and proceeds to handle the next request without waiting. This non-blocking, asynchronous approach enhances efficiency and responsiveness, making Node.js an excellent choice for handling concurrent operations.</p><h3 id="use-cases-of-node-js" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#use-cases-of-node-js"><span>Use Cases of Node.js</span></a></h3><ul><li><strong>Generate Dynamic Page Content</strong>: Node.js can dynamically generate web page content, making it a powerful tool for building dynamic web applications.</li><li><strong>File System Operations</strong>: With Node.js, you can perform various file system operations such as creating, opening, reading, writing, and deleting files on the server.</li><li><strong>Handle Form Data</strong>: Node.js can collect form data submitted by users on web forms.</li><li><strong>Database Operations</strong>: Node.js facilitates database operations, allowing you to add, delete, and modify data in your database.</li></ul><h3 id="anatomy-of-a-node-js-file" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#anatomy-of-a-node-js-file"><span>Anatomy of a Node.js File</span></a></h3><p>Node.js files contain tasks that execute in response to specific events, such as a user attempting to access a port on the server. These files, typically denoted with a &quot;.js&quot; extension, must be initiated on the server to take effect.</p>',13);function p(u,m){const t=s("RouteLink");return n(),a("div",null,[h,i("p",null,[e("With this foundational understanding of Node.js, you're ready to dive deeper into its capabilities and explore "),r(t,{to:"/docs/"},{default:d(()=>[e("server-side JavaScript development")]),_:1}),e(".")])])}const j=o(c,[["render",p],["__file","what-is-nodejs.html.vue"]]),w=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/get-started/what-is-nodejs.html","title":"What is Node.js?","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"What is Node.js?","index":true,"icon":"book-open","category":["Getting started"],"footer":false,"description":"In this guide, we'll explore what Node.js is, how it works, and its various use cases.
